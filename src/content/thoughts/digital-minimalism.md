In a world of constant notifications and endless scrolling, I've been exploring the concept of digital minimalism. 
It's not about completely disconnecting, but rather about being intentional with our digital interactions.

## What is Digital Minimalism?

Digital minimalism is a philosophy that helps us question which digital tools add value to our lives. It's about being selective with our technology use and ensuring that each digital tool serves a specific purpose.

## Key Principles

1. Intentional use
2. Value-driven choices
3. Mindful consumption

The goal isn't to eliminate technology from our lives but to create a sustainable relationship with it.
